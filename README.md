# ChristopherClarete_Dapp
# Hello World 
this is a simple DApp that will allow a particular organization to create a vesting schedule for their tokens.
# Description
This simple DApp which will have a front end and Solidity Smart contracts with the following functionality:
An organization should be able to register themselves and their token (basically spinning off a contract for one ERC20 token).
Organisation should be able to mention the type of stakeholder and their vesting period (timelock).
Org should be able to whitelist addresses for certain stakeholders (founders, investors etc.).
Whitelisted addresses should be able to claim their tokens after the vesting period.
# Getting Started
To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.
Once you are on the Remix website, create a contract first. create a file and name it OrgRegistry.sol.This contract will handle organization registration

Then create another file and name it TokenVesting.sol This contract handles the vesting of tokens.
Now  create the front-end pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the ether.js library
